Explaining the burnout paradox
=================================

Short url: http://ebmgt.github.io/burnout-paradox

This project was undertaken due to the finding in our second NHS study which quantified the contributions of burnout, engagement, and job recommendation to SHMI. 

Until recently, burnout in the NHS was best measured by "During the last 12 months have you felt unwell as a result of work related stress?" This is justified by Schaufeli's finding a strong association stress and burnout (R: 0.66 to 0.74) between burnout and physical stress (1). About 35% to 40% of staff before COVID answered yes to this question ([link to plot at NHS - https://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/results/interactive-results/](https://public.tableau.com/shared/XMYRNQWDR?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))

This analysis unexpectedly found that higher burnout was associated with *lower* Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI)(2).

We hypothesize that this finding is due to short term stress at work may be associated with improved performance. The detection of this may be due to the unqiue data structure of the NHS Staff Surveys in which burnout is only measured over the last year. So, the workforce can improve short term performance under stress.

This study is important as it may help explain the gap between practice and evidence-based management (EBMgt) (3-7).

## Methods
### Staff surveys
* Starting in 2021, the NHS has added the following questions each autumn:

These new questions are important as depersonalization subscale may have the most impact on quality of care (8).

### SHMI
Hospital Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) annual reports are available at https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/shmi#past-publications

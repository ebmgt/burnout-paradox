# Explaining the burnout paradox

This project was undertaken due to the finding in our second NHS study which quantified the contributions of burnout (measured by "During the last 12 months have you felt unwell as a result of work related stress?"), engagement, and job recommendation to SHMI. This analysis unexpectedly found that higher burnout was associated with *lower* Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI)(1).

We hypothesize that this finding is due to short term stress at work may be associated with improved performance. The detection of this may be due to the unqiue data structure of the NHS Staff Surveys in which burnout is only measured over the last year.
